## What?

A Haskell/ClojureScript version of NIA website, for learning purposes. You can see the current static site [here](https://github.com/bhlieberman/nouvelles-impressions-a-fric). It uses the Scotty Web library to serve a minimal backend. Eventually it will provide the text files that will be rendered by React on the frontend.
